# Rain Random Enemies
Rain Random Enemies is a mod that adds an event that will rain down random enemies.
Every once in a while, the world starts to spawn in enemies from the sky for a while.
After killing a certain amount of enemies, or waiting for the event out, then there is a chance that a random boss will spawn. 
Alternatively, you can enable progression mode where the random enemies will only be around your point in the progression of the world.

you can use the /rre command to get info about the event.
Everything in this mod is configurable to your needs.
