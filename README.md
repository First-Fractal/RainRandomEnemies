# Boss Adrenaline Mode
Rain Random Enemies is a mod that adds an event that will rain down random enemies.
Every once in a while, the world starts to spawn in enemies from the sky for a while.
After killing a certain amount of enemies, or waiting for the event out, then there is a chance that a random boss will spawn. 
Alternatively, you can enable progression mode where the random enemies will only be around your point in the progression of the world.

Everything in this mod is configurable to your needs.
